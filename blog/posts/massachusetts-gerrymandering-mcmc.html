      <p>This post summarises my MSc dissertation (University of Leeds, 2021) on detecting partisan bias in electoral maps using <strong>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)</strong>, applied to <strong>Massachusetts</strong>. It blends statistics with legal context and shows how computational sampling can inform fairness debates.</p>

      <h2>Why MCMC for redistricting?</h2>
      <p>We rarely have access to the full space of all valid districting plans, so judging whether a given plan is an outlier is difficult. MCMC lets us <em>sample</em> from the space of valid plans and compare the plan in use against an ensemble using metrics like efficiency gap and partisan symmetry.</p>

      <h2>Data set and constraints</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Built a Massachusetts dual graph (municipalities as nodes; adjacencies as edges).</li>
        <li>Validity constraints: equal population (thresholded), contiguity, and limited splits.</li>
        <li>Created and merged multiple sources (including 2020 presidential voting) into a single analytical data set.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Two proposal functions</h2>
      <h3>Boundary Flip</h3>
      <p>Iteratively flips a boundary node from one district to a neighbour, preserving validity constraints. Easy to explain but tends to produce long, snaky districts; mixes slowly and can struggle with contiguity.</p>
      <h3>Recombination ("ReCom")</h3>
      <p>Samples a pair of adjacent districts, builds an induced subgraph, draws a random spanning tree, and cuts an edge to form two new districts that meet constraints. Implies contiguity and produces more compact plans. Each step is heavier, but ensembles diversify faster.</p>

      <h2>Metrics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Efficiency gap</strong> (wasted votes),</li>
        <li><strong>Partisan symmetry</strong>,</li>
        <li><strong>Compactness</strong> proxies (e.g., cut edges, boundary length).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>On a <strong>35% adjustment level</strong>, the ensemble suggested the <strong>original map exhibits some Democratic bias</strong>.</li>
        <li>Across other adjustment levels, evidence was not consistently significant.</li>
        <li>ReCom produced <em>more varied and compact</em> plans with quicker ensemble diversification; Boundary Flip required far more iterations to explore the space.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p><strong>Is Massachusetts gerrymandered?</strong> Based on the ensembles generated, I did <em>not</em> find concrete evidence that would meet a robust legal standard. Some bias appears at one adjustment level, but strong outlier evidence (e.g., more biased than 95% of sampled plans across conditions) wasn‚Äôt met given the sample sizes.</p>

      <h2>Further work</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Scale up sample sizes (e.g., 10k+ ReCom, 1B Boundary Flip) for tighter confidence.</li>
        <li>Finer-grained adjustment levels and sensitivity analysis.</li>
        <li>Port the pipeline to other states; the dual-graph methodology generalises.</li>
      </ul>
