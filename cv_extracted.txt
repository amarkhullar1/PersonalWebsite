Amar Khullar 

Personal profile 

I am an experienced software engineer, who enjoys fast paced and collaborative work environments that allow me to utilise my problem 
solving, teamwork and engineering skills. The last 3+ years at Netcompany has provided me with an array of experiences: building complex 
cloud architectures  (AWS, Terraform, Python), back-end engineering legacy NHS systems, unearthing valuable insights from large datasets 
using Databricks, and navigating rainbow teams through complex problems - collaborating with both colleagues and stakeholders. I am keen 
to expand  my skillset further through new experiences and technologies. 

Employment experience 

                    January 2023  – Present 
Netcompany – Senior Software Engineer 
NHS Relationship Network (May 24 – Present): Leading development to create: a relationship network datastore for NHS PDS, an ingestion 
pipeline to add relationships to the network, and a RESTful FHIR API to expose relationships to consumers; with the goal to enable 4.5M+ 
children plus 350K new children per  year to receive medical care by proxy via the NHS app. 

•  Designed and implemented an ETL data ingestion pipeline (S3, Lambdas, SQS, DynamoDB, Step Functions) to add relationship data 
to our  Neptune datastore via GRO birth registrations, utilising a Leaky Bucket algorithm to rate limit with the PDS FHIR API. 
Currently  creating the Related Persons FHIR API to expose relationships to our consumers; Swagger/OpenAPI for specifications. 

• 
•  Writing terraform and deploying CodePipeline, Lambdas, DynamoDB & more including writing least privilege IAM policies , across 

dev and PTL accounts. 
Stack: Python  – Pydantic, Open  API, Gherkin tests; AWS – Lambda, Step functions, SQS, S3, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Neptune. 

• 
•  Weekly discussions with stakeholders to align and manage scope, user research with consumers to gather requirements. 
•  Working in an Agile team – running stand-ups, sprint reviews, refinements, demos and more. 

NHS Autofix (Oct 23 – May 24): Creating the Address Quality Service API in AWS as well as integration to NHS Spine II with the purpose of 
adding UPRN’s to the address field in NHS PDS, through interfacing with the OSPlaces API; saving the NHS £200,000+ per year. 

• 

• 

Created a RESTful FHIR API to enrich NHS PDS address data quality; using AWS API Gateway, Glue, Lambdas and SQS utilising 
Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) and Python. 
Spine integration work was Python development in a complex legacy system (NHS Spine II) to call the API and handle the response 
within core existing workflow; using integration tests & performance tests to ensure flow wasn’t disrupted. Stack: Linux, Python, 
NGINX, Jenkins, PyTest. 

•  Delivered a system that has added 1.5M UPRNs to PDS and applies 50,000 more each month, saving the NHS over £200,000 per 

year in vaccination letters that we don’t need to send. 

NHS DQIP (Jan 23 – Oct 23): Leading a data science team to discover pain points and automate manual processes. We implemented an ML 
tool to save 60s+ per case for back-office staff, saving over 4,000 hours of work per year; freeing up resources & reducing NHS backlog. 

• 

Built a decision tree classification machine learning model in Python to identify duplicate records, involving: Data extraction, 
cleansing, feature selection, modelling and evaluation. Context was learnt from capturing assumptions during workshops. 
•  Data science and engineering work was done using Apache Databricks – writing SQL queries, PySpark user-defined functions, and 

utilising libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, and SKLearn to ETL data gathered from several large NHS datasets. 

•  Delivered a classification model to save NBO staff over a minute per duplicate work item case, saving the NHS £80,000+/yr.  

Netcompany – Software Engineer: 

    October 2021  – December 2022
